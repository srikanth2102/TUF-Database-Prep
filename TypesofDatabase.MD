# Types of databases
1. Relational database -- data is stored in tables with predefined relation between tables. The tables will have a strict schema.
2. NoSQL -- No strict schema. Data is stored as key value pairs.
3. Object Oriented database -- Data is stored as objects in the database.
4. In-Memory database -- Data is stored in the memory rather than in the disk. Thus the data retrieval and performance is fast.
5. Time-Series database -- To record the events happening with respect to time. Key will be time and the value will be the events.
6. Spatial database -- Used for geometry or something. Not clear on this.
7. Multi-media database -- Used to store the multi-media files like photos, videos and text and such stuff.
8. Columnar database -- Instead of data stored row wise, data will be stored in columns. 
9. XML database -- XML based database. 
10. NewSQL database -- combination of RDB & NoSQL. To overcome the shortcomings of both RBD and NoSQL databases.
11. Blockchain database -- Here the data is stored in blocks. Decentralized database.
