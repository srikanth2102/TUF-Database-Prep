# Database Management System

## Data
Any fact that can be stored can be said as data. Eg: 12, Orange

## Information
- Processed data is information. Eg: Fruit: Orange, Age: 12
- Here there is no ambiguity in the data. Like just  by saying orange it could be anything. Orange the color or the fruit. But now when it is mentioned like Fruit : Orange. There is no ambiguity.

## Databases
- Collection of inter-related data can be said as a database.
- Eg: College database where there could be staff table and students table.

## File System
- File Systems were the predecessors to DBMS

### Disadvantages of File Systems
1. Data Redundancy
2. Poor memory utilization
3. Data Inconsistency
4. Data Security
